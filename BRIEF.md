## David Hofshi: A Libre David Hebrew

"David Hadash" was released by Linotype in 2012. It's a faithful rendering of the original sketches by Ismar David for the David Hebrew typeface. The font included 9 styles - 3 book weights, 3 cursive weights and 3 sans weights.

Google has worked with Monotype to release the 3 book weights (Regular, Medium & Bold) in the Open Font License (OFL) and create a new version for use by the public.

This project includes working with the David Hadash sources to create a new version:

1. Adapt the original sources to fit the standard David Hebrew in use today, as required by Israeli government & academia (David is the official font for Israeli correspondence).
2. Rework glyphs that might need to be updated, i.e. the New Sheqel glyph.
3. Add a Latin equivalent font to work with the Hebrew characters, must be an open font (i.e. Gentium).
4. Implement all features required for diacritic marks and Hebrew-specific use cases.
5. Contribute online specimens for examining the fonts and to test them for errors to the https://github.com/impallari/Font-Testing-Page project.
