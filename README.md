# David Hofshi
This Libre version of the David Hebrew is based on David Hadash, released by Monotype Corporation in 1995. David Hadash is a modern digitization of the original sketches for the typeface drawn by Ismar David and approved by his estate.

## What typographic features are available in David Hofshi?
* Full Hebrew set with diacritic marks (nikud)
* Extended Latin set, based on the Gentium typeface with additional symbols
* Alternative Hebrew-height numerals (available as Stylistic Set 1)
* Alternative "Hebrew ampersand" symbol designed by Ismar David (available in Stylistic Set 2)
* Alternative Sheqel symbol designed by Ismar David (available in Stylistic Set 3)

## How is David Hofshi different from David Hadash?
Every effort was made to keep the original designs intact. However, several changes have been made to fit with David Hofshi's goal to be used as a free alternative to the "David" font installed on Microsoft Windows computers:
* In order to be compatible with documents previously set in Microsoft's David, David Hadash's glyph size has been reduced by 12.5% and overall tracking of the Hebrew characters have been tightened by 40 em units. This was made to prevent cases in which documents previously typed in Microsoft's David to take up more pages and cause odd line breaks.
* Latin characters from the Gentium typeface are being used as the Latin character set in David Hadash, to accommodate cases in which Latin and Hebrew characters will be used in tandem.
* Diacritic marks have been completely remade.
* Biblical cantillation marks are not supported.
* The Sheqel symbol has been redesigned to be recognizable by contemporary Hebrew readers. The original Sheqel symbol is too far from today's standard.

## Who made David Hofshi?
The construction of David Hofshi was made by Meir Sadan, commissioned by Google for the Google Fonts project.
